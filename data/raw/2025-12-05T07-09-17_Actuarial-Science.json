          "text": "Actuarial Science is based upon the application of mathematical techniques to reduce the impact of such hazards as loss of income through death, disability, or retirement, or loss of property through fire, accident, or theft. Actuaries are the chief architects of life, health, and property insurance plans, and pension plans, and bear the major responsibility for their financial soundness. By using concepts from the areas of probability and finance, actuaries model, forecast and value the costs of benefits that will be provided to the participants in such plans. Methods developed for modeling insurance risk can also be applied to modeling investment risk, and actuaries apply their expertise to the valuation of sophisticated investment vehicles such as options on equities, bonds and other investment derivatives.ACT230H1andACT240H1, though somewhat technical, are courses of interest to a wide audience, since almost every student will from time to time be either a saver or a borrower, and will be covered by insurance and pension plans. Other actuarial courses deal with more specialized topics, and are generally taken by students with a more serious interest in the field or who want to pursue a career as an actuary. University of Toronto's Actuarial Science programs are fully accredited by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries and most professional requirements at the Associate level (ACIA) can be satisfied through courses in the actuarial programs. We are also designated as Society of Actuaries' Center for Actuarial Excellence (CAE)."

For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land."
