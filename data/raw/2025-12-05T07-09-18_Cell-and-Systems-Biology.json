In particular, molecular and microscopy approaches are revealing the incredible complexity of cells. With additional principles drawn from chemistry, physics and information science, we are beginning to understand this complexity and how it transcends multiple scales to organize molecular networks and cellular systems into fully functional organisms."

Our research laboratories conduct cutting edge research of fundamental processes using a diverse range of model systems (bacteria, yeast, plants, nematodes, insects, fish, frogs, mice, mammalian cell culture and others). Our undergraduate programs reflect this diversity and research strength. Since cells are the basic units of life, it is important to understand how molecular mechanisms control cells and how cells organize the development and physiology of whole organisms. These relationships encompass molecular biology, cell biology, developmental biology, genetics and physiology. These relationships are also complex, requiring studies of dynamic molecular and cellular networks: systems biology. One core component of systems biology is the integration of large datasets arising from the genomics revolution. In addition, computer modeling and bioinformatics are integrated with biochemical, structural, molecular and microscopy studies to understand genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes of the cell and organism."
